			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or

---thread.h---
Added two fields to struct thread:
	int64_t wake_up_time;               /* Time to wake up current thread */
	struct list_elem alarm_elem;        /* List element for alarm queue */

---timer.c---
Added an alarm_list which contains all the sleeping threads.
	static struct list alarm_list; /* List of blocked threads waiting for alarm */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

When a a thread calls timer_sleep() it means that it's going to sleep for a 
while. We first calculate the wake up time, which is given by start+ticks. 
To avoid busy waiting, a thread in sleep should be blocked, and a new
thread should get started to run. The way we keep track of all the sleeping 
thread is through the alarm_list. Since this list is global and shared among
all threads, it's modification should be protected by disbling interrupts. 
One more reason to disable interrupt is that blocking a thread will incur schedule(), so when doing context switch we should disable interrupt.

One thing to consider is the sequence in which the sleeping threads are
inserted. Since at each tick we should check if there's a thread that needs to be waken up, it's better to keep the queue sorted by the wake up time. Hence we did list_insert_ordered for each sleeping thread with their wake up time from small to large. Thus, the searching complexity will be smaller. 



>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

We kept a sorted alarm_list at timer_sleep(), so in the timer interrupt handler
we only need to peek the front of the queue to see if a thread needs to be 
waken up. This complexity is k*O(1), where k is the number of threads that 
should be waken up at the same time.
---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

The race condition is avoided by disabling interrupts when we manipulate the 
alarm list and blocking the current thread. Therefore when multiple threads are
trying to sleep, only one thread can manipulate the alarm_list and block it self.
This operation is therefore atomic.
>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

The timer interrupt handler also manipulates the alarm_list, since it try to see
if the time comes to wake up some thread and get them out of the list. However,
in both the timer interrupt handler and the timer_sleep, both manipulation to the
global variable of this alarm_list is protected by disabling interrupts. So no race
condition could happen. 
---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

There are several design considerations in current implementation: first the
sleeping threads are kept track of through the alarm_list, each thread is added
an additional node, the alarm_elem that link them together. Another additional
component is the wake_up_time. All these two adds upto 16 Byte to the structure
of thread, since they are small compared to 4KB space and they are static 
allocated, they won't lead to stack over flow. The other consideration is the sorted
alarm_list, which decreased complexity during timer interrupt handler.

One alternative approach, with the motivation of avoid adding more components
in the thread structure, is to make another structure that points to the waking
thread and recording this thread's wake up time at same time. It has an additional
list_elem component that link them together. 

	struct node{
		struct thread *t;   //pointer to the sleeping thread
		int64_t wake_up_time; //when to wake up
		list_elem element;  //link these nodes together
	}

This approach has the advantage of not occupying additional space to thread
structure. However, each time a thread trys to sleep we have to dynamically 
allocate such a node to track the sleeping node, and when it wake up we have 
to free such a node. This overhead should be taken into consideration. However,
in our approach, we don't need to dynamically allocate a space to trake the 
thread, we just link the thread itself to the alarm_list. Neither do we need to free
the space when we wake up the thread.
