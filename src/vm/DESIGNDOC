       MEMORY MAPPED FILES

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

struct thread
{
  ...
  struct hash mmap_files;            /* Hashtable of memory mapped files */
  int mmap_files_num_ever;           /* # of files ever mapped, used as key */
  ...
}
We store information about memory mapped files as a hashtable "mmap_files" in 
each thread. "mmap_files_num_ever" is used as a key inthis hashtable.

/* Memory mapped file */
struct mmap_file
{
  int mid;
  struct file *file;                  /* File the memory is mapped to */
  uint8_t *upage;                     /* User virtual address of the first
                                         mapping page */
  size_t num_pages;                   /* Number of pages mapped to the file */
  struct hash_elem elem;
};
We keep id, file pointer, starting user virtual address and number of pages in 
this struct.

The hashtable "mmap_files" is initialized when a process starts. Once a user
process maps a file to memory, pintos will populate page table and supplementary 
page table according to the information of the file to be mapped. When some 
process refers to the mapped data, it will cause a page fault and actually load 
the corresponding page. When the process unmaps the file, pintos will free
corresponding memory and supplementary page table entries and clear page table
entries. For every mapped page, if the page is dirty, write it back to the file.
When a process terminates, unmap all of its memory mapped files.

         SURVEY QUESTIONS
         ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
